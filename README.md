## Project Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of HR data through data visualization, focusing on employee attrition and workforce demographics. The goal is to enable stakeholders to understand key workforce dynamics and patterns by visually representing metrics such as total number of employees, attrition counts, attrition rates, and demographic breakdowns.
By analyzing these visualized insights, HR teams and decision-makers can better understand attrition trends across departments, genders, and education fields, along with insights into age distribution among current employees. This analysis supports more informed decisions in talent retention, employee engagement, and strategic workforce planning.
