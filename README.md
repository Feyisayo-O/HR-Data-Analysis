## Project Overview
This project aims to comprehensively analyse HR data through data visualization, focusing on employee attrition and workforce demographics. By visually representing metrics such as total number of employees, attrition counts, attrition rates, and demographic breakdowns, the goal is to enable stakeholders to understand key workforce dynamics and patterns.
By analyzing these visualized insights, HR teams and decision-makers can better understand attrition trends across departments, genders, and education fields, as well as insights into age distribution among current employees. This analysis supports more informed decisions in talent retention, employee engagement, and strategic workforce planning.
